###### A handy tip from the [Bug Slayer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/11/Bugslayer/) MSDN column:

Tip 57 - To hasten the startup of the Visual Studio .NET IDE, get rid of the Start Page. Because the Start Page requires all Web-browsing components to be loaded, you can chop off a considerable amount of startup time by skipping it. To turn off the Start Page, select Options from the Tools menu to bring up the Options dialog. In the Environment/General property page, select "Show empty environment" in the "at Startup" combobox.

Of course, with [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) installed, this causes the the IDE's start-up time to become terribly slow.Â  But it's worth it!
