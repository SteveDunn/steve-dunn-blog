The download links don't seem to work at the moment (they're still pointing to version 2.0.2).  The link to the direct download is [http://download.jetbrains.com/resharper/ReSharper-2.5-setup.exe](http://download.jetbrains.com/resharper/ReSharper-2.5-setup.exe "http://download.jetbrains.com/resharper/ReSharper-2.5-setup.exe")  (which I rather cleverly deduced from the existing broken link of [http://download.jetbrains.com/resharper/ReSharper-2.0.2-setup.exe](http://download.jetbrains.com/resharper/ReSharper-2.0.2-setup.exe "http://download.jetbrains.com/resharper/ReSharper-2.0.2-setup.exe"))

Remember though, this is Visual Studio 2005 only.
