ClearCase isn't my favourite source control system.  I find the UI clunky and for the most part, it's way over engineered.

I've just tried deleting a file and I'm getting an error message that says:

> Trigger "NO\_RMNAME" has refused to let rmname proceed.   
> Unable to remove "\[file\]".

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN AND HOW DO I DELETE A FILE?!

My 20+ years of working with software - coupled with my powers of deduction, have led me to "guess" that this means I don't have the permission to delete a file! (I could be wrong;  I'm waiting for the in-house ClearCase administrator to advise!)

I'm going to stop using the advanced features of this software and continue with the basics...
