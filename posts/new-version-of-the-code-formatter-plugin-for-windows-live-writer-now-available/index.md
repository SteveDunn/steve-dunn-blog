The new [binaries](http://files.dunnhq.com/CodeFormatterPluginBinaries.zip) are here. One small bug fixed in the form where you edit the code: pressing return caused the OK button to fire. Doh! Thanks to [JTB World](http://jtbworld.blogspot.com/2006/08/filedependancy-object-in-autocad.html) for spotting it.
