Time to try another beta OS from Microsoft. This time, **Windows Homer Server**.  Thirty seconds in and I'm getting my first error (well, it's better than waiting 30+ minutes like back in the days of the Windows 2000 beta!)  
The error was "**Could not initialize UI subsystem**". I looked around the forums and found suggestions to try and set the DVD  
as the first boot device. Mine already was. I then found a suggestion to use different DVD burning software. Rubbish I thought and carried on searching.  
Having come to a dead-end, I tried what was suggested and downloaded the free 'ImgBurn' utility. This software is great. Not only did it fix the installation problem, but it's also a light-weight utility to burn stuff to CD's and DVD's (190mb for Nero 7, 1.5mb for ImgBurn!).  Sold!
