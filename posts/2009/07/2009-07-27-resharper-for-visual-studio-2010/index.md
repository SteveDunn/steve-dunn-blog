[![rs](images/rs_thumb-5B2-5D.png "rs")](/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/rs_thumb-5B2-5D.png) I don’t know how I missed this for so long, but JetBrains have released a [preview of ReSharper for Visual Studio 2010](http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+for+Visual+Studio+2010+%28Preview%29)! They say this version is neither 4.5.1 nor 5.0, but a preview build with some of the new 5.0 features enabled.

Looking at the nightly builds, it seems that the first release was 9th July, but there was no news on their blog, which I’ve been checking daily since June (when they said it’d be ready).

Anyway, now I can give Visual Studio 2010 another try.  I just couldn’t use it, not even for evaluation, without ReSharper!

Also, let’s not forget that version 4.5.1 for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 is also [now available](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html).
