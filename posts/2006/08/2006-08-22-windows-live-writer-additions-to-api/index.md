Maybe this already exists, but it's not immediately obviose.  When developing a plugin, the component that sits along the right side of the screen is the Content Editor.  WLW has its own color scheme and to intermingle\* nicely with it, it'd be nice if the color(s) used were available.

\*is that a word?!
