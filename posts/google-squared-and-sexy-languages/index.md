[Google Squared](http://www.google.com/squared) looks like an interesting tool.

There’s some interesting results.  I searched for [‘programming languages’](http://www.google.com/squared/search?q=programming+languages#). 

It displays a list of languages, a picture of the language, a description, and what it was influenced by.

I was very surprised to see the **Miranda** language (apparently influenced by Haskell).  Try it yourself:  scroll down to Miranda.  I must take a closer look at this one!

Apparently influenced from Stackless Python.  I’d say more like alcohol!
